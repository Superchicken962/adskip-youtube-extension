<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 16, 2024</p>
<h3>Information Collected</h3>
<p>The extension collects simple data from you and stores it locally with the chrome storage api. Such data stored with this method are: variables that indicate if a feature should be enabled or disabled, or change the feature slightly and user statistics. There are intentions to in the future collect statistics data, which would include a basic identifier for the user, such as your username.</p>
<h3>How Your Information is Used</h3>
<p>Locally stored variables are used to give you customisation on how the extension works, such as enabling/disabling certain features, or direct user inputted values. If any data is collected and stored outside of your computer, it will be for tracking statistics and placing users on a global leaderboard based on their performance with the extension.</p>
<h3>When Your Information is Shared</h3>
<p>Only your statistics along with your username will be shared to other users, with your username being shared only to identify you.</p>
