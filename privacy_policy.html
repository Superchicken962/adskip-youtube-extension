    <h3>Information Collected</h3>
    <p style="color:red">*Data storing can be disabled from the extension window</p>
    <p>The extension collects simple data from you and stores it locally with the chrome storage api. Such data stored with this method are: variables that indicate if a feature should be enabled or disabled, or change the feature slightly and user statistics. From v1.1.0 of the extension, your personal identifying information will be stored. This only includes your google account id, and optionally a username to show on the leaderboard.</p>
    <h3>How Your Information is Used</h3>
    <p>Locally stored variables are used to give you customisation on how the extension works, such as enabling/disabling certain features, or direct user inputted values. Your google account id and your extension username will be used for tracking statistics and placing you on a global leaderboard with other users based on their statistics</p>
    <h3>When Your Information is Shared</h3>
    <p>Only your statistics along with your account id and chosen username (different to google username) will be shared to other users, with your username being shared only to identify you. You can disable data collection and delete any existing data stored from the extension window.</p>
